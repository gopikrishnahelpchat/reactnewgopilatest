But when his past catches up with him, she cannot forgive him for the deceit their relationship is built on. He loses her forever. That`s when Aditya Srivastav (Riteish Deshmukh) enters the picture.

Despite himself, or maybe to take his mind off Simmi, he agrees to teach Dittu the rules of the game. In that process, he melts and warms up to the boyish charm of his `student`. That`s when his world is spun upside down - he is forced to face facts that are a slap in the face. Suddenly Roy, who prides himself on being able to cheat anyone and anything, is pushed into a corner from where there is no exit.
